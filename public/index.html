          <br />Here's a little about me.
          <br/> I love coding because it's hard, often uncomfortable, never ending, and deeply rewarding. re is always the new
          to understand, efficiencies to discover, improvements to unlock. As I have a lot to learn and a love for teaching,
          I 'm looking for a team that has a strong interest in personal development.
          <br />
          <br /> Currently, I am focused on learning from a team-oriented production environment. Here are a few things I am hungry
          to learn more about:
          <ul>How to function as part of a team focused on solving problems and shipping code</ul>
          <ul>How to best support team members and departments</ul>
          <ul>How to make the best use of feedback to improve my performance</ul>
          <ul>How to consistently meet goals and deadlines</ul>
          <ul>How to develop the best coding standards and practices</ul>
          <ul>And I'm really looking forward to better understanding the project planning and development process.</ul>
        </p>
        <p class="all">
          For the past several years I have been an educator and leader in the sailing and maritime world. I've learned a lot about
          being part of teams in demanding environments, mounting multi-day expeditions, leading novices and pros alike,
          educating at all levels, and I'm excited to bring these experiences to a new environment.

          <br/>
          <br/> How I've learned:
          <br />

          <br />It might be easiest to call me a self-taught programmer, but I've been carried on the shoulders of giants the whole
          way. From Codecademy to Leetcode to endless blog posts, tutorials, books, meetups, and friends, I've had a lot
          of help. I completed the Telegraph Academy prep course, which was like a 6-week night school for web development,
          and came back as a teaching assistant. For me, there is nothing — absolutely nothing — half so much worth doing
          as helping others find their way to their own "ah-ha!" moments.
          <br />
          <br /> I love the learn-by-teaching process so much I started my own teaching experiment. My mission: find a few folks,
          new to programming, that wanted to spend some time learning with me. Daily, I would build out the curriculum and
          jump in to help get them unstuck as needed. It would be remote, free, and, for myself, still deeply afflicted with
          imposter syndrome, totally terrifying! With the gentle encouragement and guidance of a remarkable mentor, it became
          all of these things. But it also became relentlessly satisfying. For 30 days I led a group of 4-6 students through
          a crash course in computer science and JavaScript programming. I called it the
          <a href="https://github.com/CirrusCollective/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cirrus Collective</a>.
          <br />
          <br /> Between then and now, I spent countless days and weeks pair programming with a friend who lives in NYC,
          <a href="https://github.com/tandcsurf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larry Stiers</a>. Larry was at a similar point in his coding journey and was as willing to throw as many hours
          at this process as I. Soon, Larry and I were stumbling, hacking, and bashing (our heads against the wall) together
          for hours everyday. Day in and day out since August ’16 we would put in 6-10 hour days.
          <br />
          <br /> We’ve learned about
          <span class="skill">data structures</span>. We’ve crunched loads of algorithms. We’ve learned about
          <span class="skill">HTTP requests</span> and
          <span class="skill">encodings</span> and we’ve built servers to handle them using
          <span class="skill">Node</span> and
          <span class="skill">Express</span>. We learned more
          <span class="skill">JavaScript</span> and implemented frameworks like
          <span class="skill">jQuery</span>,
          <span class="skill">Angular</span>,
          <span class="skill">React</span> and are currently chowing down on
          <span class="skill">React Native</span>. [Source code
          <a href="https://github.com/standardhuman/positivebalance/tree/master/other%20frameworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, but please avert your eyes from these abominations].
          <br />
          <br /> We’ve built out backends with
          <span class="skill">Node</span> and
          <span class="skill">Postgres</span>, and really like back-end as a service options like Firebase. We are writing tidier, more potent
          code with
          <span class="skill">ES6</span>. We’re making prettier UIs faster and easier with
          <span class="skill">Flexbox</span>. We’ve learned how to speed things up by decluttering the
          <span class="skill">critical rendering path</span>. We’ve learned to better manage our versioning messes via
          <span class="skill">git</span> and
          <span class="skill">GitHub</span>. We’ve made our homes at the
          <span class="skill">command line</span> and
          <span class="skill">MDN</span> and
          <span class="skill">Stack Overflow</span> and in
          <span class="skill">Atom & VS Code</span> and
          <span class="skill">Chrome dev tools</span>. We’ve experienced the value of autonomy, the power of
          <span class="skill">pair programming</span>, how to build software and how to
          <span class="skill">work remotely</span> with someone we’ve never met.
          <br />
          <br /> But mostly we’ve learned a lot about
          <span class="skill">how to learn</span>.
          <br /> Since you've read this far, why not say
          <a href="./contact">hello</a>?
