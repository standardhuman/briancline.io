He is extremely patient and incredibly knowledgeable about all aspects of sailing. The thing I loved the most about taking lessons with Brian is that I felt he had complete confidence in me.

Unlike other teachers who tell you too exactly what to do, or don't assist when a student really needs help, Brian knows just how much to guide a student to maximize learning by doing. Brian's students learn to be sailors who think for themselves and sail with confidence with a proper safety mindset.",

      {/* The Approach */}

              <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                <p>
                  Every lesson happens on your boat, in your slip, on the water you actually sail. No classrooms, no shared boats with strangers. You learn the systems you'll actually use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I teach you to think through situations, not just follow a checklist. That means you'll handle the unexpected — an engine that won't start, a sudden wind shift, a tight dock under pressure — because you understand what's happening, not just what to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Singlehanding is part of every lesson plan. Even if you usually sail with crew, knowing you can handle the boat alone changes everything about your confidence on the water.

                <p>
                  Over more than a decade of instructing, hundreds of students have entrusted me to develop their confidence as recreational and professional mariners in the most challenging conditions around. From fundamental sailing skills to long-distance cruising, I specialize in calm, high-quality training tailored to your specific goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your training starts with a free 1-hour planning session and complimentary vessel inspection. Together we'll discuss your goals, go over your vessel, and develop a plan that works for you. You'll leave knowing how to move forward in a practical, actionable way — and you'll know exactly what your boat needs, if anything, to be a safe, functional vessel.
